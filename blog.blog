We recently released the <a href = “http://apps.urban.org/features/social-security-data-tool/”>Social Security Data Tool</a>, to explore and visualize Social Security data. One of our goals when creating the tool was to make the data behind it free and open, but the tables displayed in the tool are pulled directly from the <a href = "https://www.ssa.gov/policy/docs/statcomps/supplement/">Social Security Administration’s (SSA) 2014 Annual Statistical Supplement</a>, a public document. So what's the difference between public data and open data? What does it mean to be more or less open?

To be "open", data needs to be easily accesible to as wide an audience as possible. Often, this means making the data available in a machine-readable format. If you wrote down some numbers on a napkin, or put an image of a table in a PDF document, a computer would have a lot of trouble figuring out what those numbers were. But if you put them in a text document, separated by commas (called a <a href = "http://data.okfn.org/doc/csv">CSV</a> document) you could easily analyze, visualize, and explore those data. There's a wonderful primer on what it means to be machine readable over at <a href = "https://www.data.gov/developers/blog/primer-machine-readability-online-documents-and-data">Data.gov</a>, but some of the core tenants include simplicity and ubiquity. A CSV file is as simple as it gets, and you don't need any special software to read it. Extracting data from a PDF requires <a href = "http://tabula.technology/">special software</a> and lots of effort, and even XLS files assume the user has Excel (free alternatives exist, but the less a data format requires specific software, the more open it is).

While the SSA source data is available in PDF, HTML, and XLS files, we decided to translate those data into two of the most widely accepted open, machine readable formats: CSV and JSON. When you create a chart in the tool, you can click "Download" to get the data behind the chart as a CSV. It's likely that this file will open in Excel, so it might not seem too different from the XLS data available from SSA. However, a CSV is very simple, with a consistent format: one row of header values, separated by commas, then rows of data, each value separated by a comma. The XLS files contain formatting, hidden columns, nested headers, and many more complications. Much of the work of translating the SSA data into the machine readable formats which are used to build the visualization was extracting the data from XLS files (you can see the almost <a href = "https://github.com/UrbanInstitute/social-security-data-tool/blob/master/scraper/supplement_xlsx_to_json.py">thousand lines of code it took on github</a>.

The tables and charts in the tool are stored in JSON (Javascript Object Notation) files. While a JSON doesn't open in Excel, it's often the most useful format for programmers to use, since it allows for more
