  Net interest includes net profits or losses on marketable investments. Beginning in 1967, the trust fund pays administrative expenses on an estimated basis, with a final adjustment including interest made in the following fiscal year. Net interest includes the amounts of these interest adjustments. The 1970 report describes the accounting for administrative expenses for years prior to 1967. Beginning in July 1974, figures include relatively small amounts of gifts to the fund. Net interest for 1983-86 reflects payments for interest on amounts owed under the interfund borrowing provisions. During 1983-90, net interest reflects interest reimbursements paid from the trust fund to the general fund on advance tax transfers.

  The “Trust fund ratio” column represents asset reserves at the beginning of a year as a percentage of expenditures during the year. The table shows no ratio for 1957 because no reserves existed at the beginning of the year. For years 1984-90, reserves at the beginning of a year include January advance tax transfers.
