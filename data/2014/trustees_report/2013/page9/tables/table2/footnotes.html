  Net interest includes net profits or losses on marketable investments. Beginning in 1967, the trust funds pay administrative expenses on an estimated basis, with a final adjustment including interest made in the following fiscal year. Net interest includes the amounts of these interest adjustments. The 1970 report describes the accounting for administrative expenses for years prior to 1967. Beginning in October 1973, figures include relatively small amounts of gifts to the funds. Net interest for 1983-86 reflects payments for interest on amounts owed under the interfund borrowing provisions. During 1983-90, net interest reflects interest reimbursements paid from the trust funds to the general fund on advance tax transfers.
