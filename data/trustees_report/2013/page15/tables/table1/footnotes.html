  The change in the 75-year valuation period from last yearâ€™s report to this report means that the 75-year actuarial balance now includes the relatively large negative annual balance for 2087. This change in the valuation period results in a larger long-range actuarial deficit. The actuarial deficit includes the trust fund reserve at the beginning of the projection period.
